### A basic set of styles for responsive light touch typography

This is a stylesheet that is meant to represent the best practices of responsive web typography as reconmended by the  'Web Typography' book by Richard Rutter

When I first started using css, resets were all the rage, however this book makes the case that device default style differences are a good thing. That the difference represent the different form factors and scenarios a browser made be used in and therefore they should be embraced.
